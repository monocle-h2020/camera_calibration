"""
Walk through a folder and create NPY stacks based on the images found. This
script will walk through all the subfolders of a given folder and generate
NPY stacks one level above the lowest level found. For example, in a given file
structure `level1/level2/level3/image1.dng`, stacks will be generated at
`level1/level2/level3_mean.npy` and `level1/level2/level3_stds.npy`.

Images are assumed to be in the `images` subfolder (see `data_template`).

By default, the save folder is the same as the data folder, but with `images`
replaced with `stacks`.

For particularly large data sets, use the `stack_heavy.py` script instead.

Command line arguments:
    * `folder`: folder containing data. Any RAW (and optionally JPEG) images in
    this folder and any of its subfolders will be stacked, as described above.

TO DO:
    * Allow input/output folders that are not in `images` or `stacks`
