"""
Determines the linearity of the response of each pixel in a camera using RAW
data. The Pearson r coefficient is used as a measure of linearity.

Command line arguments:
    * `folder`: the folder containing linearity data stacks. These should be
    NPY stacks taken at different exposure conditions, with the same ISO speed.
