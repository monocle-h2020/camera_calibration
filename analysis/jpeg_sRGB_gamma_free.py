"""
Compare JPEG linearity data to sRGB models with free gamma factors and find the
best-fitting gamma and normalisation as well as the R^2 value of the best-
fitting model.

These calculations are all done for each individual pixel.

Command line arguments:
    * `folder`: the folder containing linearity data stacks. These should be
    NPY stacks taken at different exposure conditions, with the same ISO speed.
